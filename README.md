# NR-JT-Packet_Decode
Node-Red &lt;-> *JT* Packet Decode Flow

Latest version (08/06/21) of my Node-Red Decoding of WSJT/JTDX Packet Decodes, With Country Names for Origin Station and Destination Station (If available in message), as well as Grid Decode of Transmitting station, with bearing and distance (Also, if available in message)

Turn on message outputs to inspect parsed messages to inspect message payloads.

Set your Grid Square in the 'MY GRID Location function.

This works without internet access, all parsing of data, conversions of locations and distance calculation are done via functions. No other nodes are required to use this.

Enjoy!
